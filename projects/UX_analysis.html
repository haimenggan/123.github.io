    <p class="section-title" >PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 3%;">“When we are far away from a goal, we tend to be in an approach mindset, where we respond best to advantages. But the
closer we get to the moment of truth where we adopt or acquire your meme, we are increasingly in an avoidance mindset,
where we would respond best if you dispelled our concerns.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 2%;">“More recently in 2007, psychologists Eric Knowles and Dan Riner reformulated this into the omega strategy of persuasion,
acknowledging that overcoming resistance is a strategy that is often overlooked.”</p>
<p style="margin-top: 2%;">“One set of persuasion strategies attempts to increase the attractive features of the alternative; the second set attempts to
decrease the negative features of the alternative. We have called the first one the alpha strategies because they seem always
to be the first ones attempted... We have called the second set the omega strategies because they attempt to reduce the
resistance to selecting an alternative, because omega is the universal sign of resistance, and because they seem often to be
the last strategies considered.“</p>

<p class="column-content">GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using
git. GitHub offers plans for both private repositories and free accounts.
The screenshot 1 is from GitHub’s plan check-out page. The users
have two plans, unlimited pubic repositories for free and unlimited
private repositories for 7$/month, to choose from.
On the right of the personal plan, it has a list of contents that both
plans are in common. If users incline to the plan of unlimited private
repositories, they would like to learn more about benefits different
from the free plan. Besides, the similarity of step 2 “choose your plan”
and “choose your personal plan” might confuse users. Does GitHub
have more plans available for users? What are the experience users
might have after they pay for the plan?</p>

<p class="column-content">The screenshot 2 is next part of the check-out page. Users need to fill
in credit card number before they take next steps. But without knowledge
of the benefits of fee-for-service plan, users might not pay for it.
If the users click “learn more,” the link will jump to another page, which
might lower conversion rate.
Instead of dispelling concerns of users who might want to pay for the
personal plan, the check-out page gives out unrelated information,
such as “send me updates on GitHub news, offers, and events”.

    <p class="section-title" >SUGGESTIONS</p>
<ul class='unorderedList'>
<li>Change the order of check-out steps. Before users fill in their credit card number, the page should have
more plans for users to compare with.</li>
<li>Curate benefits of the fee-for-service plan and place these benefits above the commons of both plans. </li>
<li>Add a link that says “ Tailor your GitHub experience.  Chat with us or schedule an appointment.”  to address the users’ concerns.</li>
<li>Eliminate links that might lead users to external webpages. If the users click “learn more,” it will appear an information box explaining
selecting option. Therefore, users can stay in the same page.</li>

    <p class="section-title" >BUSINESS OUTCOME METRICS
</p>
<ul class='unorderedList'>
<li>If the recommended suggestions are effective, the conversion rate will be higher, which indicates that users are satisfied with
benefits information of fee-for-service plan. </li>
<li>The number of users that pay for the plan will become higher after they chat with GitHub service.</li>
<li>The number of users that leave the check-out page will decrease, if the information boxes are in effect.</li>
<li>Conduct a survey to see users satisfaction after they use the recommended fee-for-service plan for a month. The following
questions are recommended to ask in the survey: Is GitHub service helpful for you to choose a plan? Are you satisfied with
the current plan? If you have new requirements, would you like to chat with GitHub service for recommendations? Would you
give us suggestions to improve our service?</li>
