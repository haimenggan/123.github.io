      <p>Xinno health is a cross-border health tech summit hosted in Seattle, WA. It brings together clinicians, technologists, researchers, public health officials, and experts from both the Pacific Northwest and China for three days of in-depth discussions, seminars, and networking.
<!-- I was fortunate to participate in the preparation process and was assigned as a visual designer. My work in this project includes <strong>summit branding guideline, website design, invitation letter design, brochure design, and banner design.</strong>  -->
</p>

<p class="section-title" >My roles</p>
  <h3 id="subTitle">Collaboration</h3>
  <p>I partnered with a designer, an engineer and project manager to uncover insights and translate concepts into brand guidelines and website design that address audience motivation and needs.
</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 3%"id="subTitle">Cross Medium Design</h3>
<p>I designed the website with my project manager and another designer. I executed wireframes, prototypes and high-fidelity mockups. I also designed printed artefacts that include <strong>invitation letter, brochure, signature board, banner and swags based on the brand guidelines.</strong>
</p>

<p class="section-title" >The challenges</p>
<p>How might we create Xinno Health's brand guideline and design artefacts to promote this summit?</p>

<p class="section-title" >Kick off</p>
<p>We kicked off this project with a meeting with stakeholders and sent out a questionnaire to learn about stakeholder's needs.</p>
<a href=""> The link of questionnaire</a>
<p>From the questionnaire, we set the business goals of this project:
<div class='unorderedList'>
<ul >
<li>Attract more people to participate to this summit on October</li>
<li>Increase the online ticket sales</li>
<li>Make sure the brand is in consistency</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="subTitle">Moodboard</h3>
<p style="color: grey ;font-size: 18px;"><i>I gathered brand inspiration based on the results of the questionnaire and brand audit.</i></p>
<p> I think it’s SO important to not just find images of the ‘style’ that you are going for or the fonts that you want to use. Those things are more of a literal translation of what you want to accomplish with that project. And while those elements are important, I think the moodboard should be reserved for higher-level thinking — abstract images, patterns, & phrases. These are going to be the images that evoke an emotional response and translate how what you are making will make other people feel.</p>

<p> Shared this with stakeholders to make sure our visions are aligned.
  Often times, this step will lead to more clarity with relations to the goal of the project because thoughts
   or ideas that were not able to be articulated in the project brief come to light.

          <p class="column-content">Cross-border collaboration, technology, and innovation are keywords representing the core mission of Xinno Week. The logo design helps convey a comprehensive meaning of "international", "global", "technical", and "connective". Because the logo is slender and thin, I used a bold "2018" to balance its relatively light visual effect.</p>

<p class="section-title" >What I have learnt</p>
<ul class="unorderList" style="font-weight: bolder; font-size:1.2em;">
  <li>Engineering constraints should be inscribed early in the design process
</li>
<p>Since the client used Squarespace as the CMS, we faced great amount of technical issues when executing the design.
  For example, we include the primary menu and secondary menu in our design, but none of the template in Squarespace
  supports the menu design and the add-on codes did not work in Squarespace. Therefore, we had to change design to make
  sure we have two menus when using the template. I considered this as a design failure and will make sure inscribe engineering
  constraints in the early stage of design. </p>
  <li>Don’t use your own assumptions to decide everything.
</li>
<p>Having meetings or send out a questionnaire are helpful for you to understand business goals from stakeholders.
   Based on the information you have from the questionnaire and meetings, you can provide a moodboard to verify your assumptions of
   what the stakeholders would like to see in their brand.

  For example, we include the primary menu and secondary menu in our design, but none of the template in Squarespace supports the menu design and the add-on codes did not work in Squarespace. Therefore, we had to change design to make sure we have two menus when using the template. I considered this as a design failure and will make sure inscribe engineering constraints in the early stage of design.    </p>
  <li>Do your research before ask
</li>
  <p>You might have thousands of questions in the design process. But most of them can be solved by googling. It would be better to do your research before ask, which can save other’s time.
    But  at the same time, its important to be not blocked on a doubt for more than a certain amount of time and in that case use other’s assistance to get the work done quickly.
</p>
<li>	Communication is a must</li>
<p>As a new member and junior designer in the team, it’s hard to present your design thinking with confidence when you know people in your team have more experience and deeper understanding of the product. That is true that you might not come up with the right design. However, communication with your team is the key to verify and improve your design. You can also learn from other designer’s design thinking process to make up for your own design.
</p>
</ul>
