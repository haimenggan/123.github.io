    <p class="section-title" >Overview</p>
      <p>Xinno health is a cross-border health tech summit hosted in Seattle, WA. It brings together clinicians,
technologists, researchers, public health officials, and experts from both
the Pacific Northwest and China for three days of in-depth discussions, seminars, and networking.</p>

<p>My task was to <u>design a website and printed artifacts to introduce Xinno Health Summit
  and attract people who are intersted in health-tech to buy summit tickets online.</u>

<p class="section-title" >Collaboration</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><h5>MY ROLE</h5></p>
  <p>Being the lead UI/UX designer in the team, I got to work with stakeholders, product manager and developers frequently, discussing user needs, business goals, and refining my design constantly.</p></div>

</div>
<p class="section-title"  style="margin-top: 2%; margin-bottom: 1%;">Define the challenges</p>
<p><span class="smallTitle">Interviews: </span>
I interviewed 3 stakeholders to understand their requirements
and expectations of the website design and design artifacts.
 </p>
<p><span class="smallTitle">Competitive analysis:</span>I analyzed three similar health-tech summits to learn more about their
  offerings, identities, brand strengths and brand weaknesses to find out the brand opportunity for Xinno Health.</p>
<p><span class="smallTitle">Mood Board:</span> I gathered brand inspiration based on the results of the interviews with stakeholders and
  competitive analysis.Shared this with stakeholders to make sure our visions are aligned. Often times, this step will
  lead to more clarity with relations to the goal of the project because thoughts or ideas that were not able to be articulated in the project brief come to light.</p>

<p><span class="smallTitle">Research Findings:</span></p>
<p><strong>Findings from interviews and discussions with stakeholders:</strong></p>
<p>01/ Target audience</p>
<img src="../assets/credible_cosigner/research.png">
<p style="color: #005EFE;">Pain points and needs:</p>
<p>• Health tech leaders in the US are seeking business partnerships in Asia, but they do not know how to connect with asian health tech leaders because of the cultural and language barriers.</p>
<p>• Health tech leaders in the US and Asia are seeking investment and finanace channels to bring their products to the market.</p>
<p>• Health tech investors are searching for promising startups to invest.</p>
</br>
<p>02/ Bussiness goals</p>
<p>Attract target audience to buy tickets online to participate in Xinno Health Summit.</p>
</br>
<p >03/ Build up the Xinno Health brand</p>
<p style="color: #005EFE;">The relationship between Xinno, Xinno Health and Xinno Week.</p>
  <p>Xinno is a brand created by VestLink in 2018. Xinno Health and Xinno Week are two main summits of Xinno. In May 2018, Xinno Week was sucessfully hosted in Seattle. As a corelated summit, Xinno Health has to build up on the design elements that Xinno Week
  has already had, but also has its own brand guideline that can differentiate these two summits.  </p>

          <p class="column-content">Cross-border collaboration, technology, and innovation are keywords representing the core mission of Xinno Health. The logo design helps convey a comprehensive meaning of "international", "global", "technical", and "connective". Because the logo is slender and thin, I used a bold "2018" to balance its relatively light visual effect.</p>

<p class="section-title" >What I have learnt</p>
<ul class="unorderList" style="font-weight: bolder; font-size:1.2em;">
  <li>Engineering constraints should be inscribed early in the design process
</li>
<p>Since the client used Squarespace as the CMS, we faced great amount of technical issues when executing the design.
  For example, we include the primary menu and secondary menu in our design, but none of the template in Squarespace
  supports the menu design and the add-on codes did not work in Squarespace. Therefore, we had to change design to make
  sure we have two menus when using the template. I considered this as a design failure and will make sure inscribe engineering
  constraints in the early stage of design. </p>
  <li>Don’t use your own assumptions to decide everything.
</li>
<p>Having meetings or send out a questionnaire are helpful for you to understand business goals from stakeholders.
   Based on the information you have from the questionnaire and meetings, you can provide a moodboard to verify your assumptions of
   what the stakeholders would like to see in their brand.
  <li>Do your research before ask
</li>
  <p>You might have thousands of questions in the design process. But most of them can be solved by googling. It would be better to do your research before ask, which can save other’s time.
    But  at the same time, its important to be not blocked on a doubt for more than a certain amount of time and in that case use other’s assistance to get the work done quickly.
</p>
<li>	Communication is a must</li>
<p>As a new member and junior designer in the team, it’s hard to present your design thinking with confidence when you know people in your team have more experience and deeper understanding of the product. That is true that you might not come up with the right design. However, communication with your team is the key to verify and improve your design. You can also learn from other designer’s design thinking process to make up for your own design.
</p>
</ul>
